      <h1>Alamir's Extended Grappling Rules</h1>
      <p class="lead">So you want to grapple?<br> From deep within Alamir's Palace, sages, alchemists and trainers have codified
      the rules for grappling.  Only a few gnomes were hurt in the process.</p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Players always try to grapple.  They are creative and I don't want to limit their creativity.  These
        extended rules are meant as optional for use with D&D 5th edition (TM) or a generic D20 system.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise indicated, the existing rules for grappling in DMG apply.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grappling is an attack</li>
        <li>Grappling is a contest between STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics)</li>
        <li>Attacker and defender both choose which skill to use, they do not need to be the same</li>
        <li>The difference between the two rolls indicates what happens.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <th>Difference</th>
            <th>Result</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>No effect</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1 to 3</td>
              <td>Target is Restrained</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4 to 7</td>
              <td>Target is Restrained and/or Disarmed (attacker chooses)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>8 to 14</td>
              <td>Target is knocked Prone.  Attacker may choose to follow target to the ground</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>15+</td>
              <td>Target is Prone.  Attacker may choose to inflict 1d4 + DEX or STR</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>There are special rules for the situation when either of the participates are holding a weapon.</p>
      <p>If the attacker has no weapon, but the defender is armed, the defender gets an opportunity attack unless
        the attacker has advantage or the target is restrained or prone.
      </p>
      <p>If the attacker is holding a weapon or shield and the defender is not, the attacker grapples with disadvantage.</p>
      <p>If the defender is restrained, they can attempt to break free or use an ability that does not require the use 
        of their hands.
      </p>
      <p>If both the attacker and defender are holding weapons or shields, a clinch may result.</p>
      <p>To break free, the restrained entity chooses either STR (Athletics) or DEX (Acrobatics) as does the entity doing the restraining.
        The roll is a contest.  If the restrained entity's roll is higher, they break free.
      </p>
      <p>The defender is restrained until they break free or until the attacker releases them.</p>
      <p>While restraining, the defender can make an attack with a light weapon.  Reloading is not possible.</p>
      <p>If the attacker makes such an attack, the defender gets advantage to break free from restraint next round.</p>
      <p>If the attacker knocks the defender prone, the attacker can decide to follow them down.  If they do, the defender
        remains restrained on the ground.  Otherwise they are not restrained - just prone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-danger">What about creatures without weapons but still attacks?</p>
      <p class="text-danger">What about creatures with a bite attack?</p>
      <p class="text-danger">What about when the defender rolls much higher than the attacker during grappling?</p>
      <h2>Sample Grappling</h2>
      <p>The following scenarios illustrate the various aspects of the extended grappling rules.</p>

      <p>Both Grazz and the orc are not holding a weapon.</p>
      <h3>Grazz Grapples a Gladiator</h3>
      <p>Both Grazz and the Gladiator are holding a weapon.</p>
